    I had the pleasure of working for SDW on two separate occasions, first as a marketing intern and then after graduation as a tech project manager.
    I'm infinitely grateful for the opportunities I was given here and the mentorship I received from the company director, lead project manager and marketing manager.

    Initially, I re-implemented the same stock management system as I had for UZT the previous year and trained the operational staff on it's usage.
    I then took on a more marketing-oriented role by updating and modernizing the IP website and managing their social media.

    My time at UZT was invaluable as it was my first experience in a professional environment.
